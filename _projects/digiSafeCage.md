[Project's website](https://digisafecage.eu/)

The main objective of this project is to minimize the economic, environmental and social impact derived from cage losses and escapes caused by failures and breakages in the infrastructures, through the design, testing and validation of a novel digital monitoring system of the sea cages infrastructure for the management of risks derived from losses and escapes.

The innovative system is based on the implementation of the digital twin of the cages integrating the latest communication technologies such as: IoT, Cloud Computing, Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, among others. The system must also facilitate management with insurance companies in order to guarantee coverage in the event of a claim.
