Hello! I am Amalia, a scientist at [CTN-Marine Technology Center](https://ctnaval.com/) in Murcia. 

My main [research area](https://ctnaval.com/d11-ruido-submarino/) is marine pollution, especially underwater noise, and its effect on marine biodiversity. I have a strong interest in applied science aimed at informing and shaping public policies on marine environment conservation, both nationally, in collaboration with the Spanish Ministry of the Environment, and internationally, within the framework of the European Union.

Here you can also find a list of my [publications](publications and my [CV](cv).
