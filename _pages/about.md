Hello! I am Amalia, a scientist at [CTN-Marine Technology Center](https://ctnaval.com/) in Murcia. 

My main [research area](https://ctnaval.com/d11-ruido-submarino/) is marine pollution, especially underwater noise, and its effect on marine biodiversity. I am particularly interested in applied science to support the development of public policies, both at the national level for the Spanish Ministry of the Environment and at the international level for the European Union, with a focus on marine environment conservation.

Here you can also find a list of my [publications](publications and my [CV](cv).
